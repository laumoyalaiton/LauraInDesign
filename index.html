      <h2>My story</h2>

      <p>I was born and lived most of my life in Colombia for 19 years but now I am living in Toronto, Canada. The beginning of my story with arts start since I was really small dancing, I first took my first dance class when I was 7 years old since then I have been dancing professionaly, the love for arts has always been a really important life and that helps me realize I want to keep using my creativity for my life.</p>
